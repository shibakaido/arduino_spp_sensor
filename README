==================
Arduino SPP Sensor
==================

Simple controlling and data transmitting program using Bluetooth SPP.

This project uses USB_Host_Shield_2.0 to driving Bluetooth USB Dongle.

When Arduino receives "start\r" (or "stop\r") via BT connection,
it starts (or stops) transmitting sensor data.
